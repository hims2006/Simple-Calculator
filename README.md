# Simple-Calculator
Simple Calculator Program in C
This program is a simple calculator built in C that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes an operator and two operands as input from the user, then displays the result of the specified operation.

Features
Operators Supported: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
Error Handling:
If the user enters an invalid operator, the program will display an error message.
Division by zero is prevented by checking the second operand and displaying an error message if itâ€™s zero.

How to Use

Compile the Program:
gcc calculator.c -o calculator
Replace calculator.c with the filename of the program.


Run the Program:
./calculator
Input Requirements:

The program will prompt you to enter an operator (+, -, *, or /).
Next, enter two numbers (operands) for the calculation.
Example Usage:

Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter two operands: 5 3
Output: 5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00
Code Explanation
The program uses a switch statement to handle different arithmetic operations based on the operator input.

Switch Cases:

Each case (+, -, *, /) performs the respective arithmetic operation.
If the operator is /, it checks if the second operand is zero to avoid division by zero.
Default Case:

If an invalid operator is entered, the program displays an error message.
Example Output
Addition:


Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter two operands: 5 3
5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00
Division by Zero:


Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): /
Enter two operands: 5 0
Error! Division by zero.
